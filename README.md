# 🌍 Berlin Smart-Grid AI Optimizer
**An AI-driven simulation for energy efficiency in urban power grids.**

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a high-performance **ICT solution** designed to optimize energy distribution using **Reinforcement Learning** and **FastAPI**. It simulates a smart-grid environment where an AI agent manages power loads, battery storage, and market pricing to prevent blackouts—aligning with Germany's *Energiewende* (Energy Transition) goals for 2026.

### Key Skills Demonstrated:
*   **Backend Engineering:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, RESTful API design.
*   **AI/ML:** Reinforcement Learning (Gymnasium/Stable-Baselines3).
*   **Architecture:** OpenAPI 3.1 (OAS) standards for financial data.
*   **Compliance:** Built following PEP 8 Python standards.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
*   **Language:** Python 3.11+
*   **Web Framework:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)
*   **ML Libraries:** Gymnasium, NumPy
*   **Documentation:** Swagger UI / ReDoc (OAS 3.1)
